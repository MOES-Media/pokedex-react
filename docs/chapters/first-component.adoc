== First Component: PokeListItem

image:assets/img/pokelistitem.png["Figure - PokeListItem Component", role="right"] 
Before we start building our first component we need to make a clear distinction between representational components and logical components. 

* *Presentational Components*
** Main concern: how things look
** Usually contain both DOM markup and styles of their own
** Have no dependencies on other part of the application like state 
* *Logical Components*
** Main concern: how things work
** Is composed of presentational components, can but mostly don't have DOM markup
** Loads data from the store and provide it to the presentational components

=== Component: PokeListItem

The first component we are going to create is a PokeListItem. This is just a styled button that handles an onClick event. +
Since this is a presentational component it needs to receive all it's props from the Container above and bubble it's events upwards. +
We'll start by creating this component with basic html styling, afterwards we'll refac this to an implementation with styled-components.

=== Visual testing & documentation with Storybook

By now we've spent some time developing our first component, but we could write all the code we want, without testing it there's no way of telling it works. +
So how do we go about testing our component, first we'll start by creating stories for Storybook, this will add documentation and a visual way to check your components. Afterwards we'll test the behaviour of our component through unit testing and we'll also create a snapshot test, which tests the rendering of the component.

==== Setting up storybook

So let's dive right in and add Storybook to our project. Luckily for us, Storybook has a handy CLI tool for adding Storybook to existing projects. This removes the need of manually adding the correct dependencies and doing the setup of Storybook. +
Run `npx sb init` in the root directory of your project. At the time of writing both Storybook and create-react-app come with a dependency on babel-loader, however the versions don't match and this will throw compilation errors. To resolve this issue add a resolutions block in your package.json with the correct version to babel-loader.

~package.json~
[source,json]
----
{
  ...rest omitted for brevity
  "resolutions": {
    "babel-loader": "8.1.0"
  }
}
----

Storybook itself comes with a couple of examples so we can test our installation straight out of the box. Run `yarn storybook` to start storybook in development mode, this will add a live reload server so you don't have to restart after every change. +
If everything went well you should see output like this:
----
│   Storybook 6.3.1 started                          │
│   11 s for preview                                 │
│                                                    │
│    Local:            http://localhost:6006/        │
│    On your network:  http://192.168.0.176:6006/    │
----

If you go to link:http://localhost:6060[http://localhost:6060 ] and are greeted by following screen everything went well and Storybook is ready to be used.
