== First Component: PokeListItem

image:assets/img/pokelistitem.png["Figure - PokeListItem Component", role="right"] 
Before we start building our first component we need to make a clear distinction between representational components and logical components. 

* *Presentational Components*
** Main concern: how things look
** Usually contain both DOM markup and styles of their own
** Have no dependencies on other part of the application like state 
* *Logical Components*
** Main concern: how things work
** Is composed of presentational components, can but mostly don't have DOM markup
** Loads data from the store and provide it to the presentational components

=== Component: PokeListItem

The first component we are going to create is a PokeListItem. This is just a styled button that handles an onClick event. +
Since this is a presentational component it needs to receive all it's props from the Container above and bubble it's events upwards. +
We'll start by creating this component with basic html styling, afterwards we'll refac this to an implementation with styled-components.
