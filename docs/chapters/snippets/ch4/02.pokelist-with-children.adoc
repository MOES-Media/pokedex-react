We'll start by creating the first example, where we'll pass the PokeListItems from the previous chapter as children. +
First we'll need the PokeList Component, as stated in the previous chapter you're free to choose how you do your styling (css/SASS/styled-components/...), but for the sake of consistency we'll use styled-components here and every other example throughout this tutorial.

~src/components/PokeList/index.tsx~ +
[source,tsx]
----
import React, { FC, PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledPokeList = styled.div`
  background-color: #bff9ff;
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 1.25rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  padding: 1rem;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
`;

const PokeList: FC<PropsWithChildren<any>> = ({children}) => (
    <StyledPokeList>
        {children}
    </StyledPokeList>
);

export default PokeList;
----

We then can use this component in the following fashion:

[source,tsx]
----
const pokemons: any[] = [
    {
        id: 1,
        sprite:
          "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png",
      },{
        id: 2,
        sprite:
          "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/2.png",
      },
  ];

const PokeOverview = () => (
    <PokeList>
        { pokemons.map(pokemon => (
                <PokeListItem
                    sprite={pokemon.sprite}
                    onClick={() => {console.log(`you clicked pokemon: ${pokemon}`)}}
                    key={pokemon.id} <.>
                />
            ));
        }
    </PokeList>
);
----
<.> When creating react components through a map function you have to provide a unique key to every react component you created. In our case it's the pokemon ID.
